    <h1>Pancakes</h1>

    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

    <p>These pancakes are really simple to make and don’t require any special ingredients, which makes them easy to whip up on any given Saturday morning. They’re light, airy, and so fluffy they practically bounce off the plate. There are no crepe-like pancakes here; I can tell you that for sure! (though I do love a good crepe when the craving calls! But today, we’re going big and pillowy.) I often make a double batch and freeze the extras for easy breakfasts during the week. I just pop them in the microwave to warm up, and hey presto, pancakes on demand. </p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <p><ul>

        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li> <br>

        <li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li> <br>

        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li> <br>

        <li>¾ cup warm milk</li> <br>

        <li>2 Tbsp melted butter</li> <br>

        <li>1 large egg</li> <br>

        <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li> <br>

        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li> <br>

        <li>4 tsp cooking oil</li> <br>

    </ul></p>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

    <p><ol>

        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li> <br>

        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract.</li> <br>

        <li>Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until combined. DO NOT overmix. The mixture should be thick, but still pourable, and a little bit lumpy. If it's not pourable, add an additional tablespoon or two of milk until it is thick, but pourable. Let the batter rest for 15 minutes.</li> <br>

        <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium. Once hot add enough cooking oil to coat the surface (I use about ½ tsp per pancake). Add the batter to the hot griddle, ¼ cup at a time. Use the back of the measuring cup to spread the batter into a 4.5-inch diameter circle.</li> <br>

        <li>Cook until bubbles form over the surface and begin to pop, the edges look dry, and the bottom is golden brown (about 60 seconds). Flip them and cook on the second side until golden brown (about 30 seconds).</li> <br>

        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet between batches or as needed, until all the pancakes have been cooked. Keep them warm on a plate under a towel or in a warm oven until all of the remaining batter has been cooked. Serve warm with your favorite toppings!</li> <br>
